# McDonald-s-DB
McDonald's Database Simulation

# Introduction:
Welcome to the McDonald's Database Simulation Project! This repository hosts a comprehensive simulation of a database system tailored for McDonald's, the renowned fast-food chain. This project aims to create a realistic representation of McDonald's operations through a well-designed database schema, detailed entity relationships, and optimized queries. The contributors to this project are Vincenzo Bucciero, Camilla De Martina, and Noemi Ruocco.

# Project Files:

  *  McDonalds.pdf: This document provides an overview of the McDonald's Database Simulation, offering insights into the project's goals, design principles, and data structures.
  *  modello_concettuale.jpeg: This file contains the conceptual model representing the high-level structure of the database.
  *  modello_relazionale.jpeg: This file contains the relational model depicting the detailed relationships and tables within the database.
  *  popolamento.sql: This SQL script file contains data population queries, enabling the simulation with sample data.
  *  procedure.sql: This file includes SQL procedures that define specific actions or operations within the database.
  *  tabelle.sql: This file contains the SQL statements for creating the necessary tables in the database.
  *  trigger.sql: This file contains SQL triggers that are executed automatically in response to specific events on a particular table or view.
  *  vincoli_check.sql: This file defines check constraints to enforce specific conditions on the data in the database.
  *  viste.sql: This file contains SQL queries defining views, providing simplified and meaningful perspectives on the underlying data.

# How to Use:
Clone the Repository:

```
git clone <repository_url.git>
```
```
cd McDonalds-Database-Simulation
```

# Database Setup:
* Create a new database in your preferred DBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
* Execute the tabelle.sql script to create the necessary tables.
* Populate the database with sample data using the popolamento.sql script
* Run the trigger.sql script to set up triggers for automated actions.
* Execute the procedure.sql script to define specific database procedures.

# Exploring the Project:
  Refer to McDonalds.pdf for an in-depth understanding of the project's structure and objectives.
        Review the conceptual model in modello_concettuale.jpeg and the relational model in modello_relazionale.jpeg for visual representations of the database design.
        Utilize the SQL views defined in viste.sql for simplified data access.
        Contribute to the project by making enhancements, fixing issues, or proposing new features.
